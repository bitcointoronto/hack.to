In this blog post we will highlight why one should DIY as much as possible when using bitcoin.

> There are several reasons why people may choose to engage in DIY (Do-It-Yourself) activities related to Bitcoin:
>
> 1. Privacy: Some people prefer to take a DIY approach to Bitcoin to maintain their privacy. By setting up their own Bitcoin nodes and wallets, they can reduce their reliance on third-party services and keep their personal information more secure.
> 2. Control: By setting up their own Bitcoin nodes and wallets, people can have more control over their Bitcoin holdings. They can choose which transactions to participate in, how much to spend on transaction fees, and which security measures to put in place.
> 3. Learning: Many people are interested in Bitcoin because of the technology behind it, and DIY activities can help them learn more about how the system works. By setting up their own nodes and wallets, they can gain a deeper understanding of how Bitcoin transactions are processed and how the blockchain functions.
> 4. Cost savings: Depending on the size of their Bitcoin holdings, some people may find that setting up their own nodes and wallets is more cost-effective than using third-party services. They may also be able to save on transaction fees by setting their own fees and prioritizing their own transactions.
