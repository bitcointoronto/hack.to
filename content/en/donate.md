You can help us launch this project by donating Bitcoin, either on-chain or via Lightning, to our crowdfunding campaign down below.

While we are working to setup the legal non-profit entity, the donations are collected personally by Alekos Filini, and will be transferred over to the non-profit (excluding the opening legal fees) once that's ready.

The funds collected with this campaign will be spent mainly on (in no particular order):

- Legal fees
- Rent deposit
- Furniture
    - Desks
    - Chairs
    - Couches
    - Lights
- Hardware
    - Video Projector/TV
    - Speakers and wirless mic
    - 3D printer
    - CNC/Laser Cutter
    - Soldering irons
