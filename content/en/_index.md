BitcoinToronto is a Meetup group which aims to have [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Toronto, Canada. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about Bitcoin, technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other like-minded individuals. We are a community for Bitcoiners, created by Bitcoiners.

We plan to regularly host workshops, meetups, hackathons, and more, open to everybody.

We are not funded in any way. If you want to support our project you can join the Meetup [group](https://meetup.com/bitcointoronto), and get involved with our community through the Telegram [chat](https://t.me/+0g_MO0GudG00OTMx), as well as attend meetup events. Furthermore, if you are well-versed with GitHub you can contribute ideas to our Discussions [page](https://github.com/orgs/bitcointoronto/discussions), as well as even write an educational blog post by creating a pull request for it [here](https://github.com/bitcointoronto/hack.to/pulls). If not, search on YouTube how it's easy!

## Coming Soon

We are in the process of securing a location for the hackerspace. We will open to the public once that happens.In the meantime, we host IRL meetups in Toronto, virtual meetups, as well as maintain the DIYbitcoin Twitter [account](https://twitter.com/DIYbitcoin) and Telegram chat.

You can help out by joining the community and getting involved! We are open to everyone, and while Bitcoin is censorship-resitant we do ask to keep it mostly civil in our community chat and at events. We want to foster a community where everyone can learn and be themselves. For example, there are a lot of male dominated Bitcoin communities which are raw and unfiltered where shitposting, and vulgar comments and media are shared - we don't want that.
