BitcoinToronto is a Meetup group which aims to have a [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Toronto, Canada. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about Bitcoin, technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other like-minded individuals. We are a community for Bitcoiners, created by Bitcoiners.

We plan to regularly host workshops, meetups, hackathons, and more, open to everybody.

## Coming Soon

We are in the process of securing a location for the hackerspace. We will open to the public once that happens.

We are not funded in any way. If you want to support our project you can join the Meetup [group](https://meetup.com/bitcointoronto), and get involved with our community through the Telegram [chat](https://t.me/+0g_MO0GudG00OTMx), as well as attend our IRL and virtual meetup events. Furthermore, through GitHub you can contribute ideas to the repo via our Discussions [page](https://github.com/orgs/bitcointoronto/discussions), as well as even write an educational blog post by creating a pull request for it [here](https://github.com/bitcointoronto/hack.to/pulls).
