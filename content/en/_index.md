hack.bs is a non-profit [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Brescia, Italy. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about Bitcoin, technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other
like-minded individuals. We are a space for hackers, designed by hackers.

We plan to regularly host workshops, meetups, hackathons and more, open to everybody.

We are funded through voluntary contributions from individuals and private companies: if you want to support our project you can also [make a donation]({{< ref "donate" >}}).
We have a [transparency]({{< ref "transparency" >}}) page to show exactly how we allocate our funds.

## Coming Soon

We are in the process of setting up the legal entity and securing a location for the hackerspace. We will open to the public in Q1 2023.

You can help us cover our initial costs of rent, furniture and hardware equipment by [donating]({{< ref "donate" >}}) to our crowd-funding campaign. We only accept Bitcoin.
